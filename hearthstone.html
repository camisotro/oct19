		<p>Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft is an online collectible card game from 
			<a href="http://us.blizzard.com/en-us/">Blizzard Entertainment</a>. It was released in a closed beta in August 2013. An 
			open beta was made available in January 2014, and the final release came in March 2014.
		</p>
		<p>Hearthstone revolves around turn-based matches between two opponents, operated through Blizzard's Battle.net. Players can choose from a number of game modes, with each offering a slightly different experience. Players start the game with a substantial collection of basic cards, but can gain rarer and more powerful cards through purchasing packs of cards or as reward for completing Arena runs. In-game gold is rewarded for completing randomized daily quests, where one is given each day stacking up to three (one quest is able to be rerolled per day), and by winning matches in ranked play, where 10 gold per three wins is earned with a 100 gold limit per day.</p>
		<p>Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft has received generally favorable reviews upon release, holding a score of 87.57% on GameRankings and 88 on Metacritic, based on a dozen reviews by major video game critics. The game was praised for its simplicity, gameplay pace, and attention to detail along with being free-to-play, while the lack of actual card trading between players and any form of tournament mode were pointed out as the major shortcomings. Eurogamer gave the game the perfect score of 10 and remarked that the game is "overflowing with character and imagination, feeds off and fuels a vibrant community of players and performers, and it only stands to improve as Blizzard introduces new features, an iPad version and expansions." IGN and Game Informer both gave the game a slightly lower grade of 9/10, with IGN's Justin Davis praising the game for its "elegant simplicity of rules" and "impressive attention to detail and personality, and the true viability of playing completely for free make it easy to fall under its spell and get blissfully lost in the depths of its strategic possibilities."</p>
