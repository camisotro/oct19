		<h2>About the game:</h2>
		<p> Heroes of the storm is a Battle Arena game designed by <a         href="http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/"> Blizzard. </a> <br></p>
		<p>The game features heroes from Blizzard's franchises including Warcraft, Diablo, and StarCraft. The game uses both free-to-play and freemium models and is supported by micropayments,
			which can be used to purchase heroes, visual alterations for the heroes in the game and mounts.
			Blizzard does not call the game a "multiplayer online battle arena" or an "action real-time strategy" because they feel it is something different with a broader playstyle;
			they refer to it as an online "hero brawler".
			The game entered closed beta on January 13, 2015, and the full version of the game was released on June 2, 2015.</p>
        <h2> Gameplay</h2>
        <p>
            Heroes of the Storm revolves around online 5-versus-5 matches, operated through Blizzard's online gaming service Battle.net. Players can choose from three game modes, which include playing with/against computer-controlled heroes or other players. Killing enemy/neutral units and the opposing side's heroes grants experience points, which are shared with the entire team. When a certain experience threshold is reached for a team, each hero on that team levels up, acquiring slightly amplified statuses and gaining a talent point upon reaching levels 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, and 20. Talent points allow players to customize their hero's abilities and generally result in large increase in power, especially for levels 10 and 20. This leveling system emphasizes the importance of teamwork, since a player's action can affect the whole team. Players can also mount different creatures, such as horses or unicorns, to increase their movement speed, automatically unmounting when dealing/receiving damage or using an ability. Minions at neutral camps can be defeated to gain mercenaries that fight for the player. Each map has a different side-objective that will help either team deal significant damage to the other.
